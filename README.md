  2. Execute the following command to clone the repository from your version control server (e.g., GitHub):
```
git clone <Repository_URL>
```
### 2. Configure the Database

1. Open the `Backend/ai-labar/src/main/resources/application.properties` file.
2. Configure the database connection properties. Here's an example for an embedded H2 database:
```properties
# postgres configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ai_labar
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
```

### 4. Build and Run the Backend

#### With Command
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Spring Boot project.
2.  Execute the following command to build and run the backend:
   ```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
mvn spring-boot:run -Dmaven.test.skip=true
 ```
The backend should now be up and running at http://localhost:8080.

#### With IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and navigate to the backend project folder.
2. Import the project as a Maven project.
3. Ensure that the application server configuration is correctly set up (e.g., Tomcat).
4. Configure the database connection if needed in the `application.properties` file.
5. Run the Spring Boot application from IntelliJ IDEA.

### 5. Build and Run the Frontend

#### With Command
1. Open a terminal in the Angular project folder.
2. Run the following commands to install dependencies and build the frontend:
```
npm install
ng serve
```
The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:4200.

#### With Visual Studio Code
1. Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the frontend project folder.
2. Open an integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code.
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Edit the API configuration in the code to point to the Spring Boot backend if necessary.
5. Run `ng serve` to start the Angular development server. The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.
